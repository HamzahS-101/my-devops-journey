# Git Learning Summary  

This README highlights my recent learning journey with Git, covering key concepts and commands I’ve explored.  

## Staging Changes  
- **`git add`**: Prepares files for committing by adding them to the staging area.  

## Committing Changes  
- **`git commit`**: Saves staged changes to the repository.  
  - Used with `-m` to include clear, meaningful commit messages that explain *why* the changes were made rather than just *what* was changed.  

## Pushing Changes  
- **`git push`**: Uploads committed changes from the local repository to a remote repository.  

## Pulling Changes  
- **`git pull`**: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. It keeps your local branch up to date with the latest changes from collaborators.  

## Branching  
- **`git branch`**: Creates a new branch, allowing for isolated development without affecting the main branch.  
- **`git checkout`**: Switches between branches, enabling work on specific features or tasks.  

## Pull Requests  
- Facilitate collaboration by enabling code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.  
- Help maintain code quality and shared understanding among team members.  

## Merge Conflicts  
Merge conflicts happen when changes from different branches overlap and Git can’t merge them automatically. To avoid conflicts, pull updates regularly and coordinate with your team.  

## Git Rebase  
Rebasing rewrites commit history by moving or combining commits from one branch onto another.

## Squashing Commits  
Squashing combines multiple commits into one, creating a cleaner and more concise commit history. 

## Ignoring Files  
- **`.gitignore`**: Defines files and directories to be excluded from version control. It helps keep the repository clean by ignoring unnecessary or sensitive files.  

This learning experience has given me a solid foundation in version control and collaborative workflows. I’m excited to continue developing these skills further!
