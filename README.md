# my-devops-journey
Welcome to my DevOps Journey repository! This is a space where I will document my learning journey into the world of DevOps, including my personal notes, resources, and project documentation. Whether it's exploring foundational concepts or delving into advanced tools and practices, this repository serves as a centralised hub for everything I learn and create along the way.

# What I'm Learning

## Linux
Linux forms the backbone of most DevOps workflows. I will be exploring the basics of the Linux operating system, including file systems, permissions, processes, and essential command-line utilities.

## Bash Scripting
Automation is key in DevOps, and Bash scripting enables the creation of scripts to automate repetitive tasks, manage configurations, and simplify complex workflows.

## Git
Version control is crucial for collaboration and code management. I will learn Git to manage source code, track changes, and collaborate with teams effectively.

## Docker
Docker is a containerisation tool that allows developers to package applications with their dependencies. I will explore how to create, manage, and deploy containerised applications.

## AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud platform. I will delve into various AWS services, understanding how to deploy and manage scalable applications in the cloud.

## Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. I will learn to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using declarative configuration files.

## CI/CD
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines streamline development workflows. I will explore tools and practices to automate testing, building, and deploying applications efficiently.

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerised applications. I will learn how to deploy, scale, and manage applications in a cluster environment.

# How These Tie Into DevOps
DevOps is about bridging the gap between development and operations to create seamless, automated, and collaborative workflows. Linux provides the foundation for most servers and cloud systems, while tools like Git, Docker, and Kubernetes ensure efficient code management and deployment. Bash scripting and Terraform empower automation, reducing manual intervention and errors. AWS offers scalable infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines ensure faster and more reliable software delivery. By mastering these technologies, I aim to build the skills necessary to streamline development and operations processes, ultimately driving innovation and efficiency.
