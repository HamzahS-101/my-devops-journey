# Networking Learning  

## Why Learn Networking?  
Networking is the **backbone of IT and cloud infrastructure**. Whether you're troubleshooting connectivity issues, securing data, or optimising performance, a solid understanding of networking concepts is **essential** for any IT professional.  

For **DevOps engineers**, networking knowledge is crucial for:  
- **Cloud Deployments** – Understanding VPCs, subnets, and firewalls in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Configuring networking in Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.  
- **Security & Compliance** – Managing firewalls, VPNs, and network policies to ensure secure environments.  
- **Performance Optimisation** – Diagnosing latency, bandwidth issues, and load balancing.
