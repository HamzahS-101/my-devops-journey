# My Linux Journey
## What is Linux?

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used across servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Known for its stability, flexibility, and security, Linux serves as the backbone of many modern technologies, including cloud platforms and enterprise applications. It offers a modular design, allowing users to customise it for various purposes, and supports a vast ecosystem of tools and software.

## Why Learning Linux is Key for DevOps

Linux is the foundation of most cloud infrastructures and DevOps tools, making it essential for professionals in the field. Many DevOps practices, such as managing servers, automating tasks, and configuring containers (like Docker), rely heavily on Linux. Learning Linux gives you the skills to work with command-line interfaces, understand file systems, manage processes, and secure systems—key abilities for efficient system management and automation in a DevOps environment.

## Why I'm Learning Linux

I'm learning Linux because it’s a crucial foundation for DevOps, and I want to build a deeper understanding of the systems I work with. As I dive into automation and cloud technologies, I realised that knowing Linux will help me solve real-world problems more efficiently, whether it's troubleshooting, managing servers, or optimising workflows. It’s not just about mastering commands—it’s about becoming more confident in working with the tools and technologies that power the infrastructure behind the software I’m helping to build. Learning Linux gives me the flexibility and control to tackle challenges in DevOps with a solid, hands-on approach.

## Putting My Learning into Practice

 To put my Linux learning into practice, I’ve been working through the [**OverTheWire Bandit game**](https://github.com/HamzahS-101/my-devops-journey/blob/d4d5cc654196d7a44d0dcff6dd8b742edc4960df/Linux/OverTheWire%20Bandit%20Game/Solutions.md), a fantastic resource for mastering Linux commands and concepts in a hands-on way. I’ve completed the first 20 levels, each presenting a unique challenge that required me to apply what I’ve learned about file systems, permissions, SSH, and more. Along the way, I’ve documented the steps I took to solve each level, which not only helps solidify my understanding but also serves as a personal reference for future tasks. This practical experience has been invaluable for reinforcing my Linux skills in a real-world context.
