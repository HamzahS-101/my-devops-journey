# My Linux Journey
## What is Linux?

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used across servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Known for its stability, flexibility, and security, Linux serves as the backbone of many modern technologies, including cloud platforms and enterprise applications. It offers a modular design, allowing users to customise it for various purposes, and supports a vast ecosystem of tools and software.

## Why Learning Linux is Key for DevOps

Linux is the foundation of most cloud infrastructures and DevOps tools, making it essential for professionals in the field. Many DevOps practices, such as managing servers, automating tasks, and configuring containers (like Docker), rely heavily on Linux. Learning Linux gives you the skills to work with command-line interfaces, understand file systems, manage processes, and secure systemsâ€”key abilities for efficient system management and automation in a DevOps environment.
