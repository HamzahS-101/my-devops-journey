# My Linux Journey
## Introduction
This folder is dedicated to all things Linux. I’ll be sharing detailed notes on my Linux journey, including what I’ve learned as well as any projects I’m working on that involve Linux.

## Why Learn Linux?
Learning Linux is essential for anyone in the world of DevOps. Here's why:

- **Industry Standard**: Linux powers the majority of servers and cloud infrastructure, making it a fundamental skill for managing systems, servers, and containers in DevOps.

- **Efficiency & Flexibility**: Linux provides the tools and flexibility to automate, script, and configure systems efficiently — all critical for DevOps practices.

- **Control & Customisation**: With Linux, you have full control over your environment. It's open-source, highly configurable, and ideal for building scalable, reliable, and secure systems.

- **Powerful for Automation**: Most DevOps tools and platforms, like Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins, are optimised for Linux, making it the go-to OS for automation and CI/CD pipelines.

In short, mastering Linux is crucial for streamlining operations, speeding up development cycles, and enhancing productivity in a DevOps environment.
